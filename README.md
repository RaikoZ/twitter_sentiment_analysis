# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
A Twitter sentiment analyzer in just 14 lines of Python

## Overview

The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. We enter a single keyword and it bases it works upon it.

## Dependencies

tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

## Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via
```
python demo.py
```

API lets us access an app's functionality from our code
